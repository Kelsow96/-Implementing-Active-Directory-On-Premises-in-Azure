<h1> Implementing Active Directory (On-Premises) in Azure </h1> 

<img src="https://github.com/Kelsow96/Deploying-Active-Directory-And-Creating-Users/assets/169297569/5b730490-62e5-4e6a-99ed-903590512f80" width="600" />

<h2> What is Active Directory (AD)? </h2>
Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft service for managing users, computers, and resources in a network. It centralizes security and administrative tasks, provides authentication and authorization, and organizes data into domains and organizational units. AD ensures data consistency and easy resource management across the network.
<br>
<br/>

<h2> Overview </h2>
In this tutorial, we'll set up our Domain Controller VM (DC-1) and a Client VM (Client-1), ensure connectivity between Client-1 and DC-1 install Active Directory on DC-1, create Admin and normal user accounts in AD, join Client-1 to our domain, setup remote desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1, create additional users on DC-1, and attempt to log into Client-1 with one of those user accounts.

<h2> Environments and Technologies Used: </h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Windows Firewall
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
- PowerShell

<h2> Operating Systems Used: </h2>

-  Windows 10
-  Windows Server 2022

<h2> List of Prerequisites: </h2>

-  Azure Account/Subscription

<h2> High-Level Steps: </h2>

1. Create our VMs
  - Create Domain Controller VM:
    - Deploy a Windows Server 2022 VM named "DC-1".
    - Set the NIC Private IP address to static.
  - Create Client VM:
    - Deploy a Windows 10 VM named "Client-1".
    - Use the same Resource Group and VNet as "DC-1".
    - Verify both VMs are in the same VNet.
  
2. Ensure Connectivity between Client and Domain Controller
  - Test Connectivity:
    - Log into "Client-1" via Remote Desktop.
    - Ping the private IP address of "DC-1".
    - On "DC-1", enable ICMPv4 in Windows Firewall.
    - Confirm successful ping from "Client-1".

3. Install Active Directory
  - Install AD DS:
    - On "DC-1", install Active Directory Domain Services.
    - Promote "DC-1" to a Domain Controller, setting up a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com).
    - Restart "DC-1" and log in as mydomain.com\labuser.

4. Create Admin and Normal User Accounts in AD
  - Create User Accounts:
    - In ADUC, create Organizational Units (OUs) "_EMPLOYEES" and "_ADMINS".
    - Create a new user "jane_admin" and add to the "Domain Admins" group.
    - Log in as mydomain.com\jane_admin.

5. Join Client-1 to the Domain
  - Configure DNS and Join Domain:
    - Set "Client-1" DNS to "DC-1"â€™s Private IP in Azure Portal.
    - Restart "Client-1".
    - Join "Client-1" to the domain and restart.
    - Verify "Client-1" in ADUC.

6. Setup Remote Desktop for Non-Admin Users on Client-1
  - Configure Remote Desktop:
    - Log into "Client-1" as mydomain.com\jane_admin.
    - Allow "domain users" access to Remote Desktop.

7. Create Additional Users and Test Logins
  - Automate User Creation:
    - On "DC-1", use PowerShell to run a script that creates multiple users.
    - Test logging into "Client-1" with one of the new accounts.

<h2> Steps: </h2> 

1. Create our VMs
  - Create Domain Controller VM:
    - Deploy a Windows Server 2022 VM named "DC-1".
      - We'll use "labuser" as our Username and "Password1234" as our password. We can move straight to "Review + Create". It should pass validation, and we can create our DC-1 VM.

<br>
<br/>

- Set the NIC Private IP address to static.
  - Within DC-1 we'll navigate to "Network Settings", "Network interface: dc-1755_z1", "IP configurations", "ipconfig", finally select "Static" and "Save".

<br>
<br/>

- Create Client VM:
  - Deploy a Windows 10 VM named "Client-1".
    - We'll do the same exact steps we used to create DC-1 for Client-1. Expect we'll use Windows 10 for the operating system and DC-1's Vnet.

<br>
<br/>

2. Ensure Connectivity between Client and Domain Controller
  - Test Connectivity:
    - Log into "Client-1" via Remote Desktop.
      - We'll retrieve the Public IP address for Client-1 from the Azure Portal. Client-1's IP is 51.8.81.17. We'll use our "labuser" Username and "Password1234" for our Password.
![Capture](https://github.com/Kelsow96/Deploying-Active-Directory-And-Creating-Users/assets/169297569/d82e5cda-d587-4a75-9049-05e005bcb568)

<br>
<br/>

- Ping the private IP address of "DC-1".
  - Once we log into Client-1, we'll ping the private address of DC-1 using the command "ping -t (IP address). We'll need the private IP address of DC-1. DC-1's Private IP address is 10.0.0.4. We'll notice that our ping request is consistently timing out. That's because DC-1's Firewall is currently blocking ICMPv4 traffic.

<br>
<br/>

- We'll log into "DC-1" via Remote Desktop. We'll retrieve the Public IP address for DC-1 from the Azure Portal. DC-1's Public IP is 172.190.86.220. We'll use our "labuser" Username and "Password1234" for our Password.

<br>
<br/>
    
- On "DC-1", enable ICMPv4 in Windows Firewall.
  - We'll type "wf.msc" in the bottom search bar. Select "Inbound Rules", Sort by "Protocol" and Enable both "Core Networking Diagnostics - ICMP Echo Request (ICMPv4-IN)".

<br>
<br/>

- Confirm successful ping from "Client-1".
  - We should now see successful ping replies from Client-1 to DC-1 after Enabling ICMPv4 rules within DC-1's Firewall

3. Install Active Directory
  - Install AD DS:
    - On "DC-1", install Active Directory Domain Services.
      - On DC-1, within the Server Manager Dashboard, we'll select "Add Roles and Features" and go through the setup with the preselected configurations until we get to the "Server Roles" section. Once there we'll select "Active Directory Domain Services", we'll be prompted with a new window, and we'll select "Add Features". We'll now select "Next" on all the pages until we get to the "Install" button, and once there, we'll install AD DS.

<br>
<br/>

- Promote "DC-1" to a Domain Controller, setting up a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com).
  - Back in the Server Manager Dashboard we'll select "Promote this ever to a domain controller". Once we're in the Configuration Wizard window we'll select "Add a new forest" and make our "Root domain name:" "mydomain.com". We'll move to the next page; once there, we need to give a password for "Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)"; we'll use "Password1234". If it was already preselected, we'll deselect "Create DNS delegation" on the next page. We'll select "Next" through the following pages until we reach the "Prerequisites Check" page. Once there, we'll select "Install". As it finishes installing, it will force a restart of the VM.

<br>
<br/> 

- Restart "DC-1" and log in as mydomain.com\labuser.
  - We'll log back into DC-1, but now that DC-1 is a Domain Controller, we must log in with the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). We used "mydomain.com" as our FQDN, so we'll log in by using "mydomain.com\labuser" as our Username and "Password1234" as our Password.

<br>
<br/>

4. Create Admin and Normal User Accounts in AD
  - Create User Accounts:
    - In ADUC, create Organizational Units (OUs) "_EMPLOYEES" and "_ADMINS".
      - Within our Server Manager Dashboard we will select "Tools" and then "Active Directory Users and Computers". Right-click "mydomain.com" navigate to "New" and select "Organizational Unit (OU)". We will create a _EMPLOYEES OU and a _ADMINS OU.

<br>
<br/>

- Create a new user "jane_admin" and add to the "Domain Admins" group.
  -Right-click "_Admins", navigate to "New" and select "User". Within the new window, we'll create a new user name jane doe make their "User logon name" "jane_admin". Once all of the required fields are filled out we'll select "Next". In the next window, we'll set the password. The password will be "Password1234". We'll also deselect "User must change password at next logon" and select "Password never expires". Once all required fields are filled out, we'll select "Next" and "Finish" on the following page. Now right-click "jane doe" user account and select "Properties". In the new window, select "Member of" and then select "Add" on that page. Within the "Select Groups" window we'll type "Domain Admins" in the "Object Names" text window. Select "Check Names" to see if the group you want to add exists within the system. Select "OK" and then "Apply" to finalize adding "jane doe" user account to the "Domain Admins" group.

5. Join Client-1 to the Domain
  - Configure DNS and Join Domain:
    - Set "Client-1" DNS to "DC-1"â€™s Private IP in Azure Portal.
      - First, we must retrieve DC-1's Private address from the Azure Portal. Once we have the Private IP address for DC-1, we'll navigate to Client-1's "Networking" Settings within Azure. Within the "Networking Settings" Page we'll navigate to "Network Interface" and select "client-1652_z1". We'll now navigate to "DNS servers". Within the "DNS servers" page we'll select "Custom" type the Private IP address of DC-1 within the text box and select "Save" once finished.

<br>
<br/>

- Restart "Client-1".
  - Navigate back to the "Overview" page for CLient-1 within Azure and select "Restart"
![Capture](https://github.com/Kelsow96/-Implementing-Active-Directory-On-Premises-in-Azure/assets/169297569/0cd3be45-d471-4b20-85d5-1f63b98e2388)
<br>
<br/>

- Join "Client-1" to the domain and restart.
  - Log back into Client-1 via RDP. Once logged in, we'll confirm that we successfully added CLient-1 to the DNS Server using the command "ipconfing /all" within Powershell. We should see the Private IP address of DC-1 used for the DNS Server. Right-click the Windows symbol at the bottom left, and select "System". Select "Rename this PC (advanced). Once within the System Properties page, select "Change" from there a new window will appear, select "Domain" from the "Member of" section and type in "mydomain.com" in the text box and finally select "OK. We'll then be prompted with the Windows Security page and asked to put in a Username and Password with the correct permissions to add Client-1 to the Domain. We'll use the admin account we created in DC-1 called "jane_admin". The username will be "mydomain.com\jane_admin" and password "Password1234". Select "OK". If everything was a success we should see a Welcome to Domain window. We'll now be prompted to restart Client-1 for the changes to occur.

- Verify "Client-1" in ADUC.
  - First, we'll log back into Client-1 but this time instead of just using "labuser" for our login we can now use "jane_admin" for our login. This is because Client-1 has now joined our domain, and we gave "jane_admin" the ability to log into any computer connected to the domain. The username will be "mydomain.com\jane_admin" and the password "Password1234". We'll go back to DC-1, within Server Manager navigate to "Tools" and then select "Active Directory User and Computers". Within the ADUC window select "Computers" from "mydomain.com" drop-down menu. We should see Client-1. Within "Users" page we should see "labuser" as well.

6. Setup Remote Desktop for Non-Admin Users on Client-1
  - Configure Remote Desktop:
    - Log into "Client-1" as mydomain.com\jane_admin.
      - After our last step, you should already be logged into Client-1. If not, log in with "mydomain. comjane_admin."

- Allow "domain users" access to Remote Desktop.
    - Once logged in we'll navigate back to system properties by right-clicking the Windows symbol at the bottom right and selecting "system". This time we'll select "Remote Desktop". We'll select "Select users that can remotely access this PC" on the Remote Desktop page. Now we'll select "Add". We'll type "Domain Users" in the text box in the Select Users or Groups window. Select "Check Names" to see if the group you want to add exists within the system. Select "OK". Select "OK" again. Any domain user should now be able to RDP into Client-1

7. Create Additional Users and Test Logins
  - Automate User Creation:
    - On "DC-1", use PowerShell to run a script that creates multiple users.
      - Within the search bar at the bottom of DC-1, we'll type "powershell ise", right-click the application and select "Run as administrator". Select "Yes" when prompted. We'll navigate to this GitHub account, [Generate Names Create Users (JoshMadakor)](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1), and copy all the code within the file. Within DC-1 Powershell ISE window we'll select "New Script". Paste all of the code within the new file and select run. The script should now run and create 10,000 random usernames with the password "Password1" within the "_EMPLOYEES" OU in ADUC.

- Test logging into "Client-1" with one of the new accounts.
  - Log out of Client-1. We'll now try to log into Client-1 with one of the random users created via the script we ran. I chose user "sut.vaw" but you could use any of the usernames generated. We should successfully log into Client-1 via the random user created.

In this tutorial, we demonstrated the process of setting up a Domain Controller VM (DC-1) and a Client VM (Client-1) within Microsoft Azure. Following the detailed steps, we ensured connectivity between Client-1 and DC-1, installed Active Directory on DC-1, created administrative and standard user accounts in Active Directory (AD), and joined Client-1 to our domain. Additionally, we set up remote desktop access for non-administrative users on Client-1 and tested logins with newly created user accounts. This comprehensive guide utilized various environments and technologies, including Remote Desktop, Windows Firewall, Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), and PowerShell, on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2022 operating systems. The tutorial emphasized the importance of correct configuration and verification at each step to ensure successful domain setup and user management.
