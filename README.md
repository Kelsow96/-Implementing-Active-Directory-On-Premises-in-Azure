<h2> What is Active Directory (AD)? </h2>
Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft service for managing users, computers, and resources in a network. It centralizes security and administrative tasks, provides authentication and authorization, and organizes data into domains and organizational units. AD ensures data consistency and easy resource management across the network.

In this tutorial, we'll set up our Domain Controller VM (DC-1) and a Client VM (C-1), ensure connectivity between C-1 and DC-1 install Active Directory on DC-1, create Admin and normal user accounts in AD, join C-1 to our domain, setup remote desktop for non-administrative users on C-1, create additional users on DC-1, and attempt to log into C-1 with one of those user accounts.

<h2> Environments and Technologies Used: </h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Windows Firewall
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
- PowerShell

<h2> Operating Systems Used: </h2>

-  Windows 10
-  Windows Server 2022

<h2> List of Prerequisites: </h2>

-  Azure Account/Subscription

<h2> High-Level Steps: </h2>

1. Create our VMs
  - Create Domain Controller VM:
    - Deploy a Windows Server 2022 VM named "DC-1".
    - Set the NIC Private IP address to static.
  - Create Client VM:
    - Deploy a Windows 10 VM named "Client-1".
    - Use the same Resource Group and VNet as "DC-1".
    - Verify both VMs are in the same VNet using Network Watcher.
  
2. Ensure Connectivity between Client and Domain Controller
  - Test Connectivity:
    - Log into "Client-1" via Remote Desktop.
    - Ping the private IP address of "DC-1".
    - On "DC-1", enable ICMPv4 in Windows Firewall.
    - Confirm successful ping from "Client-1".

3. Install Active Directory
  - Install AD DS:
    - On "DC-1", install Active Directory Domain Services.
    - Promote "DC-1" to a Domain Controller, setting up a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com).
    - Restart "DC-1" and log in as mydomain.com\labuser.

4. Create Admin and Normal User Accounts in AD
  - Create User Accounts:
    - In ADUC, create Organizational Units (OUs) "_EMPLOYEES" and "_ADMINS".
    - Create a new user "jane_admin" and add to the "Domain Admins" group.
    - Log in as mydomain.com\jane_admin.

5. Join Client-1 to the Domain
  - Configure DNS and Join Domain:
    - Set "Client-1" DNS to "DC-1"â€™s Private IP in Azure Portal.
    - Restart "Client-1".
    - Join "Client-1" to the domain and restart.
    - Verify "Client-1" in ADUC.

6. Setup Remote Desktop for Non-Admin Users on Client-1
  - Configure Remote Desktop:
    - Log into "Client-1" as mydomain.com\jane_admin.
    - Allow "domain users" access to Remote Desktop.

7. Create Additional Users and Test Logins
  - Automate User Creation:
    - On "DC-1", use PowerShell to run a script that creates multiple users.
    - Test logging into "Client-1" with one of the new accounts.
